# JSU_Chatroom1
JSU Chatroom was built by JSU students for JSU students. This app connects users with either all of their peers, those are the same classification for them, or within the same college.
In order to implement this web application, you must locally host it on your machine with a program like XAMPP Apache or a local server of your choice. 
In order to access from the browser of your choice, go to localhost/public/index.html. This will take you to the login page.
This application also uses a database for users. The database is MYSQL (phpmyadmin) The table includes columns: user, password, email, classification, and college.
